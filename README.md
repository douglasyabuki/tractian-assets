### :black_nib: Improving points

While the current implementation meets the core requirements, there are several areas where performance, scalability, and user experience could be further improved:

- Batch Rendering Optimization
  > - Current Approach: The tree renders uses a batch renderer to load 10 TreeNodes every 500ms. Although it helps, the recursiveness of the TreeNode component causes each child node to trigger another batch renderer, which may lead to performance issues, especially with large datasets containing multiple nested assets, locations, and components.
  > - Improvement: Implement a dynamical batch rendering mechanism based on the Root Nodes size to its furthest branch, deciding for itself the chunk size and delay. This will reduce the initial load time, leading to a better performance and user experience.
- Enhanced Search Logic
  > - Current Approach: The current search filters components, assets, and locations based on the userâ€™s input, but it could be more optimized for performance and flexibility.
  > - Improvement: Refactor the search logic to fully leverage the pre-built searchKey field, allowing faster filtering based on concatenated id, name, status, and sensorType. This can ensure a more performant search across deep hierarchies without needing to traverse each node individually.
- Advanced Filters & Usability

  > - Current Approach: The app includes basic filters for energy sensors and critical alert status, but there's potential for more granular control.
  > - Improvement: Add advanced filters, such as:
  >   > - Location-based filters: Allow users to filter assets based on their geographic or organizational location
  >   > - Sensor type: Add more sensor types to the filtering criteria, ensuring users can easily find specific types of equipment or statuses
  >   > - Asset size or importance: Add metadata-based filters to let users view high-priority assets first
  >   > - Maintenance history: Allow users to filter assets based on their maintenance records, helping identify assets with frequent issues or recent repairs.
  >   > - Location history: Filter assets by their historical location data, providing insights into the movement or reassignment of assets over time.

- React Router Prefetching & Dynamic Routes
  > - Current Approach: The app fetches data as needed, but the performance could be improved by integrating prefetching mechanisms and better route management.
  > - Improvement: Implement react-router-dom with dynamic routes and prefetching for seamless navigation and data loading. Prefetching can be especially useful when switching between companies, loading relevant data ahead of time to reduce waiting times. Example routes could include:
  >   /companies/:companyId/assets
  >   /companies/:companyId/locations
  >   This would improve scalability and responsiveness, as users would experience minimal delays when switching between sections of the app.
- User Preferences & Internationalization
  > - Current Approach: The app has a single configuration for all users.
  > - Improvement:
  >   User preferences: Add customizable user settings, allowing users to save preferred filters, layouts, and themes for a more personalized experience.
  >   Internationalization: Implement multi-language support to ensure the app can be easily used in different regions, adapting content to local languages and formats.
- Prefetching for Filters
  > - Improvement: Implement prefetching strategies when filters are toggled, ensuring that all related data is ready for rendering when the user selects a filter. This will enhance the user experience, making the app feel more responsive by reducing wait times when applying filters like sensor type or alert status. By focusing on these improvements, the application can provide a more seamless, responsive, and efficient experience for users managing large-scale asset structures.

### Context

Assets are essential to the operation of the industry, it can include everything from manufacturing equipment to transportation vehicles to power generation systems. Proper management and maintenance is crucial to ensure that they continue to operate efficiently and effectively. A practical way to visualize the hierarchy of assets is through a tree structure.

### Challenge

> ðŸ“Œ **Build an Tree View Application that shows companies Assets** > _(The tree is basically composed with components, assets and locations)_

**Components**

- Components are the parts that constitute an asset.
- Components are typically associated with an asset, but the customer **may** want to add components without an asset as a parent **or** with a location as a parent
- Components typically include **vibration** or **energy** sensors, and they have a **operating** or **alert** status
- On the tree, components are represented by this icon:
  ![component](../assets/component.png)

**Assets/Sub-Assets**

- Assets have a set of components
- Some assets are very large, like a conveyor belt and they **may** contain N sub-assets.
- Assets are typically associated with a location, but the customer **may** want to add assets without specifying a location as a parent.
- You can know that an item is a **asset**, if they have another assets or components as children.
- On the tree, assets are represented by this icon:
  ![asset](../assets/asset.png)

**Locations/Sub-Locations**

- Locations represent the places where the assets are located. For very large locations, the customer may want to split them to keep their hierarchy more organized. Therefore, locations may contain N sub-locations.
- On the tree, locations are represented by this icon:
  ![location](../assets/location.png)

In summary, a tree may like look this:

```
- Root
  |
  â””â”€â”€ Location A
  |     |
  |     â”œâ”€â”€ Asset 1
  |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ Component A1
  |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ Component A2
  |     |
  |     â”œâ”€â”€ Asset 2
  |           â”œâ”€â”€ Component B1
  |           â”œâ”€â”€ Component B2
  |
  â”œâ”€â”€ Location B
  |     â”œâ”€â”€ Location C
  |     |     |
  |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ Asset 3
  |     |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ Component C1
  |     |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ Component C2
  |     |     |
  |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ Component D1
  |
  â””â”€â”€ Component X
```

## Features

**Asset Page**

- The Asset Tree is the core feature, offering a visual Tree representation of the company's asset hierarchy.
- **Sub-Features:**

  1. **Visualization**
     - Present a dynamic tree structure displaying components, assets, and locations.
  2. **Filters**

     **Text Search**

     - Users can search for specific components/assets/locations within the asset hierarchy.

     **Energy Sensors**

     - Implement a filter to isolate energy sensors within the tree.

     **Critical Sensor Status**

     - Integrate a filter to identify assets with critical sensor status.

  - When the filters are applied, the asset parents **can't** be hidden. The user must know the entire asset path. The items that are not related to the asset path, must be hidden

### Technical Data

You have Assets and Locations, you need to relate both of them to build the Tree.

**Locations Collection**

Contains only Locations and sub locations (Composed with name, id and a optional parentId)

```json
{
  "id": "65674204664c41001e91ecb4",
  "name": "PRODUCTION AREA - RAW MATERIAL",
  "parentId": null
}
```

If the Location has a parentId, it means it is a sub location

```json
{
  "id": "656a07b3f2d4a1001e2144bf",
  "name": "CHARCOAL STORAGE SECTOR",
  "parentId": "65674204664c41001e91ecb4"
}
```

The visual representation:

```
- PRODUCTION AREA - RAW MATERIAL
  |
  â”œâ”€â”€ CHARCOAL STORAGE SECTOR
```

**Assets Collection**

Contains assets, sub assets and components (Composed by name, id and a optional locationId, parentId and sensorType)

If the item has a sensorType, it means it is a component. If it does not have a location or a parentId, it means he is unliked from any asset or location in the tree.

```json
{
  "id": "656734821f4664001f296973",
  "name": "Fan - External",
  "parentId": null,
  "sensorId": "MTC052",
  "sensorType": "energy",
  "status": "operating",
  "gatewayId": "QHI640",
  "locationId": null
}
```

If the item has a location and does not have a sensorId, it means he is an asset with a location as parent, from the location collection

```json
{
  "id": "656a07bbf2d4a1001e2144c2",
  "name": "CONVEYOR BELT ASSEMBLY",
  "locationId": "656a07b3f2d4a1001e2144bf"
}
```

If the item has a parentId and does not have a sensorId, it means he is an asset with another asset as a parent

```json
{
  "id": "656a07c3f2d4a1001e2144c5",
  "name": "MOTOR TC01 COAL UNLOADING AF02",
  "parentId": "656a07bbf2d4a1001e2144c2"
}
```

If the item has a sensorType, it means it is a component. If it does have a location or a parentId, it means he has an asset or Location as parent

```json
{
  "id": "656a07cdc50ec9001e84167b",
  "name": "MOTOR RT COAL AF01",
  "parentId": "656a07c3f2d4a1001e2144c5",
  "sensorId": "FIJ309",
  "sensorType": "vibration",
  "status": "operating",
  "gatewayId": "FRH546"
}
```

To summarize, this is the visual representation of this items on the Tree

```
- ROOT
  |
  â”œâ”€â”€ PRODUCTION AREA - RAW MATERIAL [Location]
  |     |
  |     â”œâ”€â”€ CHARCOAL STORAGE SECTOR [Sub-Location]
  |     |     |
  |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ CONVEYOR BELT ASSEMBLY [Asset]
  |     |     |     |
  |     |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ MOTOR TC01 COAL UNLOADING AF02 [Sub-Asset]
  |     |     |     |     |
  |     |     |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ MOTOR RT COAL AF01 [Component - Vibration]
  |
  â”œâ”€â”€ Fan - External [Component - Vibration]
```
